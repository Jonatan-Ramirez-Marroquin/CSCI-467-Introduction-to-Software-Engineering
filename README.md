# CSCI-467-Introduction-to-Software-Engineering
- Course Project for CSCI 467 - Introduction to Software Engineering.
- Project assigned by professor as course project to develop C++ program simulating a web store on run time. Main development of the UI was expected to be done without much context, only given options to be presented to the user. Main challenge was to incorporate MariaDB to our program on runtime to run SQL queries to retrieve and update information on real time.
