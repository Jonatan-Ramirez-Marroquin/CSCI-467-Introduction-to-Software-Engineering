# CSCI-467-Introduction-to-Software-Engineering
- Course Project for CSCI 467 - Introduction to Software Engineering.
- Project assigned by professor as course project to develop C++ program simulating a web store on run time. Main development of the UI was expected to be done without much context. The only requirements were to give options to the user in the form of a list. The main challenge was to incorporate MariaDB to our program on runtime to run SQL queries to retrieve and update information on real time.
- Upon runtime, the user is given a list of products to browse based on the current inventory. The user has the ability to browse, add to cart, and remove from cart. The user would either log out if they found nothing they needed or complete a purchase using our checkout. The checkout requirements included calculating the total, as well as adding taxes. Credit card check was based on character length and that they were all numbers, no real information was checked.
